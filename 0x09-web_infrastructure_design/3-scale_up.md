In this infrastructure design, we will be using a load balancer (HAproxy) to distribute incoming traffic between two servers, each with their own set of components - a web server, an application server, and a database.

The reason for splitting these components into their own servers is to improve performance and scalability. By separating the web server, application server, and database into their own servers, we can scale each component independently. For example, if we see an increase in web traffic, we can add more web servers to handle the load without having to add more application servers or databases.

The load balancer is configured as a cluster with the other one to provide high availability and fault tolerance. If one of the load balancers fails, the other one can take over and continue distributing traffic to the servers.

The web server's primary function is to serve static content, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The application server, on the other hand, is responsible for processing dynamic content, such as server-side scripts and database queries. By separating these responsibilities into different servers, we can optimize performance and security for each component.

Finally, the database server is responsible for storing and managing the application's data. Separating the database from the web and application servers helps to improve performance and security by allowing us to optimize the database's configuration independently of the other components.

Overall, this infrastructure design provides improved performance, scalability, and fault tolerance, while also optimizing security and resource utilization for each component.
