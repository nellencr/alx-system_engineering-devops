Postmortem: Web Application Outage
Issue Summary
Duration: May 10, 2023, 12:00 PM - May 10, 2023, 2:30 PM (UTC)
Impact: The web application experienced a complete outage during the specified duration. Users were unable to access the service, resulting in a 100% user impact.
Timeline
12:00 PM: The issue was detected when monitoring alerts indicated a sudden drop in incoming requests to the web application.
12:05 PM: Engineers initiated an investigation into the system to identify the root cause of the issue.
12:15 PM: Initial assumption was made that the outage might be due to a network connectivity problem.
12:30 PM: Network team was engaged to investigate potential network issues, but no abnormalities were found.
1:00 PM: Debugging efforts focused on the database layer, suspecting a database failure as the root cause.
1:30 PM: The database team confirmed that the database was operational, ruling out any database-related issues.
2:00 PM: The incident was escalated to the infrastructure team to further investigate system components.
2:20 PM: A misconfiguration in the load balancer was identified as the root cause of the outage.
2:30 PM: The load balancer configuration was corrected, and the web application was restored to normal operation.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause: The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer. The misconfiguration resulted in the load balancer not properly routing incoming traffic to the web application instances.
Resolution: The load balancer configuration was corrected to ensure proper routing of incoming traffic. Additionally, automated tests and checks were implemented to validate the load balancer configuration on a regular basis.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:
Enhance monitoring and alerting: Implement more comprehensive monitoring to detect load balancer misconfigurations and promptly alert the team.
Configuration management: Strengthen the configuration management process to ensure accurate and validated configurations are deployed.
Disaster recovery testing: Conduct regular disaster recovery testing to verify the resilience of the system and identify potential weaknesses.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Patch load balancer configuration: Apply the corrected load balancer configuration across all environments.
Implement automated configuration validation: Develop automated tests to validate the load balancer configuration during deployment and periodically thereafter.
Update incident response playbook: Include load balancer misconfigurations as a potential cause in the incident response playbook, providing troubleshooting steps for quicker resolution.
This postmortem provides an analysis of the web application outage that occurred on May 10, 2023. The root cause, a misconfiguration in the load balancer, was identified and resolved. Corrective and preventative measures have been outlined to avoid similar incidents in the future, including enhancing monitoring, improving configuration management, and conducting regular disaster recovery testing.
